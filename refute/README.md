# Refute

This question type is a subtype of the gapfiller question type and is based on
Viraj Kumar's refute question type[^1].

![An example refute question](./example.png)

Refute questions present students with code and an incorrect description of what
the code does. Students must then provide a test case that "refutes" the
description by showing a discrepancy between the actual output of the code and
the erroneous description of what the code does.
